        <a class="section-title">About me:</a>
        Starting in the fall of 2024, I will be a computer science Ph.D student at Cornell University, where I will be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/">Robert Kleinberg</a>.
        My research interest is algorithm design and analysis.
        In particular I like online learning and combinatorial optimization and their applications to economics or fairness.
